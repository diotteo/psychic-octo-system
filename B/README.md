# Building

Run 'make qb'
You will need the Boost framework to be installed

# Running

To run, first build as explained above then run the 'qb' binary in the present directory with two version string arguments like so:
$ ./qb 1.10 1.2

# Limitations

At the moment, the program does not work with prerelease version strings such as '1.10-2' or '0.9-rc2'
